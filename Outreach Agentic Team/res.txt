""Skip to main content \nIan Mitchell \nIndependent Trader and Risk Manager \nMountain View, California, United States Contact Info \n793 followers 500+ connections \nSee your mutual connections \nJoin to view profile \nMessage \nIndependent Day Trader \nReport this profile \nAbout \nMy professional goal is to build long-term wealth while maintaining a consistent monthly income using very specific and self-proven trading strategies that I've developed for myself and my personality.\n\nI currently trade the morning session of the futures market and swing trade the Forex markets. I am a purely discretionary, technical trader, meaning I use my years of screen time to identify the best trade setups, and I enter and exit using the market structure and market psychology represented on a chart.\n\nI fully back-test, create, and maintain my strategies as well as update them from time to time when I see an opportunity to improve my skill. I have full control and confidence in the actions I take in the market, as they are backed up by my own experience, imagination, testing, and realization in the live market.\n\nTrading is made up largely of the following four items, in my opinion:\n\n(1) A strategy that has a probable edge in the market - This means it includes at least one universal element that has always existed in the market, such as support and resistance areas.\n\n(2) Constant adaptation - The market is always changing. A strategy must be flexible enough in order to apply it to what the market is doing NOW, not what it did yesterday, last week, or last year. The only way to truly make it in the long-term is to be proactive and makes changes when necessary. After all, trading is a life-long profession, not a one-shot deal.\n\n(3) Experience - This must be earned by each individual, and includes items such as reading market structure, applying technical analysis, understanding the ebbs and flows of trading results, and many other nuances that are learned along the way.\n\n(4) Psychology - Understanding that the market is a probabilities game, and building a solid mental state that allows you to approach the market each day with a winning attitude regardless of what happens in the interim.\nExperience \nIndependent Day Trader \nIndependent Day Trader \nJan 2008 - Present 16 years 8 months \nDay-trading the futures market during the morning session of the U.S. stock market. This includes Crude Oil, Gold, NQ, YM, and ES. Precision risk and stop management is used on each trade, along with a daily goal and daily max loss.\n\nSwing trading all Forex major and minor pairs.

Overall, the cold email is effectively structured and presents a strong case. Here are some areas that could be refined further for better impact:

1. **Customization and Personal Touch**:
   The email feels a bit generic even though you’ve mentioned Raj’s achievements. Adding a line that connects Raj’s specific experience to the need for IT solutions might strengthen the pitch.

2. **Value Proposition**:
   You have touched on what Wintellisys provides but could make it more concrete with perhaps a statistic or a specific benefit example that has helped other clients in a similar position.

3. **Call to Action (CTA)**:
   The call to action is clear, but it can be more inviting. Offering a couple of time slots might increase the likelihood of scheduling a call.

We can handle more complex multi asset portfolios and global ones spanning multiple countries. We work with over 400 index providers from the giants like MSCI, S&P and FTSE, to dozens of newer firms that might create a handful of thematic or sub-sector indices. Delivery is in one single, flexible, customisable API feed and user interface, which can accommodate all sorts of security identifiers to interoperate with other systems. This supports workflows throughout back, middle and front offices, in buy side and sell side firms \u2013 and indeed the important workflows between buy side and sell side. Operations and compliance teams use the data to drill down to position level transparency. Research teams can use it for competitor intelligence, peer group ranking and performance analysis. They can use the data to track ETF flows, highlighted in the monthly ULTUMUS flow report, understand the growth of passive AUM as well as the growing niche of active ETFs that have often converted from mutual funds to ETFs. Trading desks can rely on more timely and accurate ETF pricing with validated PCFs (for both physical and synthetic structures) before markets open, supported by ULTUMUS teams working 24/5 in US, European and Asian time zones. ULTUMUS is the largest PCF independent calculation agent globally and is often the original source for much of the ETF data it aggregates, coordinating it with important details such as holidays and non-trading days, corporate actions and dividends. This gives us more confidence in verifying data quality and accuracy, and avoiding glitches and hiccups, versus some other providers\u2019 model of relying on second hand or third hand data.

They currently strive for a 7% return. According to the CIO, they don't focus on the funded status. Only on an asset allocation that will get them the 7% long-term. Here's the issue: At 52% funded, they actually need an annual return just under 14% to maintain the current funded status shortfall. OOPS! Given current valuations for most risk assets, what is the likelihood of that happening for a protracted period of time? As both a huge proponent of DB plans and a NJ taxpayer, I'm not a fan of their approach. \n17 \n28 Comments \nPacer ETFs \nCurious about our most recent rebalance?

A significant drop, yes, but with market analysts eyeing an upward move to 63 cents post-capital return, there's potential buzz around this #ASXlisted company. \ud83d\udca1 Why the focus on Pointsbet? - A strategic asset sale led to a notable capital return, possibly repositioning its market valuation. - Its Australian and Canadian operations could be currently sitting undervalued. - The company\u2019s solid business fundamentals make it a tasty target for acquisition talks. For investors seeking opportunities on the ASX, Pointsbet is an interesting proposition.
